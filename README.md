Hi, I'm Giovanny.
 
I studied software engineering, passionate about the Java ecosystem, Spring and REST APIs.
 
Today, I am focused on providing solutions at the software level, creating ONLINE courses and, above all, helping the Java community to enrich this knowledge to make programming a 100% fun space.
